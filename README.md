# DOM Pong Demo

A Demo of using React to make a pong game using DOM elements. Also Socket.io to add multiplayer capabilities. Traditionally, browser-based games use an HTML canvas element. Let's explore one way React could be used to make a classic pong game. We can also allow two people to play against each other using websockets with the socket.io library.

This is intended to be a follow-along demo, and so it's organized in several parts. Use `git checkout <branch>` to browse the demo from specific point.
